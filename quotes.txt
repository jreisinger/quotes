Asi sa mi chce kakať, lebo je tu nejaký smrad a ide z mojej riti. -- Elka, Jún 2018

Ktovie ako sa má babka Zuzka v tej truhle? Ale to asi nikto nevie, len krtko. -- Matu, Jar 2018

Matu, ako si vysvetľuješ, že niekedy sa počas spánku pocikáš a niekedy nie? To ja nevysvetľujem, to niekto iný vysvetľuje. -- Matu, 2.2.2018

But those complex distributed systems built from hardware and software are really only extensions of much more complex distributed systems built by humans. -- Mike Loukides (https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-devops-yet-again)

We need empathy, creative thinking and participation with the users we're trying to serve. That's not easy. -- Mike Loukides (https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-devops-yet-again)

If we're just providing solutions, and not understanding the problem that needs to be solved, from the perspective of the person who has the problem, we're not doing anything. -- Mike Loukides (https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-devops-yet-again)

These days, operations staff may rarely see a computer other than their laptop: tha machines that do the work are virtual, they live at Amazon or at Microsoft or at Google or at IBM. -- Mike Loukides (2017)

As an industry, we are moving into technologies (deep learning, machine learning, microservices, autonomous operations) where it is increasingly likely that we will be dealing with complex systems, where introspection how something works is less important during the development and support cycle than whether it works. -- Casey Rosenthal (Netflix's Manager of Traffic and Chaos Teams)

Elegance and simplicity and generality all are things that, to a large extent, depend on personal taste, bacuse what seems to cover a large area for me may not cover enough for someone else, and vice versa. -- Guido van Rossum (Masterminds of Programming)

What is life? It is the flash of a firefly in the night. It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime. It is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset. -- Crowfoot's last words (1890)

It's not our job to stop the inevitable from happening; it's our job to make it more safe when it does. -- Daniel Missler (https://danielmiessler.com/blog/bruce-schneier-is-wrong-to-fear-monger-on-iot-security/)

The process of learning to create what I have in my mind has produced an epic number of mountainous piles of junk, but at the tops of those piles of junk are some works I admire. -- Zed A. Shaw

By simply attempting to create something on a regular basis I've become adept at doing it, and there is no magic to this. I just keep trying until I can do it. -- Zed A. Shaw

There's absolutely nothing wrong, self-centered, greedy, antisocial, or abusive about wanting to focus on you so you can be better at what you love. -- Zed A. Shaw

Or maybe fuzzy thinking is more comfortable for us, because it conforms to our wishes at every moment. -- Aaron Wall

Instead of trying to figure out what to return when there's an error, the int() function raises the ValueError exception and you deal with it. -- LPTHW (errors in Python)

Security vulnerabilities, exploits, and attacks that once affected only bits and bytes now affect flesh and blood. -- Bruce Schneier (2017)

Don't fight stupid, make more awesome. -- Jesse Robbins (Master of Disaster @ Amazon)

A bad system will beat a good person every time. -- W. Edwards Deming

We are taught to value simplicity and beauty. That's nice. I like circles too. However, complexity is not always the enemy. -- Larry Wall (http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/larry.html)

There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. -- C.A.R. Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture

The standard example of an acnient nonsense - the debate about angels on pinheads - makes sense once you realize the theologians were not discussing whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a finite or an infinite number. -- S. J. Gould, "Wide Hats and Narrow Minds"

Over the years, I have discovered that people usually have reasons for the things that they do. Their actions are rarely arbitrary; even things that seem perverse often make sense once you understand their objectives, and interests and priorities. -- Steven W. McDougall (http://world.std.com/~swmcd/steven/programming/code.html)

People who are able to live digitally enhanced lives, in the sense that they can use all the available tools to the fullest extent, are very much more productive and capable and powerful than those who are still stuck in meatspace. -- Ross Anderson (https://www.edge.org/conversation/ross_anderson-the-threat)

Before I became an academic, in the first dozen years of my working life, I would change jobs every year or three just so I kept moving and didn't get bored. -- Ross Anderson (https://www.edge.org/conversation/ross_anderson-the-threat)

I expect that Perl's relative importance will probably decline in the future, even while its developer base continues to increase in absolute size, because its competitors will grow faster than Perl does. -- Raymond (http://www.salon.com/1998/10/13/feature_269/)

When asked to do 30 iterations of a task, an SRE should do the first two, get bored, and automate the rest. -- PoCSA

The first version of everything is janky. Don't fear jankiness as long as you're solving a problem -- ALexis Ohanian

Don't try to write perfect code; write code that works, and then decide whether to improve your code for that project or move on to something new. -- Eric Matthes (Python Crash Course)

Most people think you automate things for speed, and you certainly can, but consistency was a much larger driver around automation for us. -- Michael Stahnke (http://sysadvent.blogspot.sk/2016/12/day-7-what-we-can-learn-about-change.html)

Have a backout plan when it makes sense, recognize when it doesn't. Rollback, without time-travel, is basically a myth. -- Michael Stahnke (http://sysadvent.blogspot.sk/2016/12/day-7-what-we-can-learn-about-change.html)

Write down the complete, detailed plan, and then make sure at least one other person reviews it. -- Chris McDermott (http://sysadvent.blogspot.sk/2016/12/day-4-change-management-keep-it-simple.html)

Perl used to be far and away my language of choice, but these days I'm more likely to write new code in Python, largely because far more of my friends and coworkers are confortable with it. -- nelhage (https://blogs.oracle.com/ksplice/entry/the_top_10_tricks_of)

Most languages are like stackoverflow: I have a question, I want the best answer. Perl is like PerlMonks: I have a doubt, I want to read an interesting discussion about it that is likely to go on a tangent. q-: -- tye (http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=783659)

A daemon that is properly started with no controlling terminal will never receive SIGHUP from the OS. Thus, it is convenient to repurpose SIGHUP to tell the daemon to read its configuration file. -- Steven W. McDougall (http://world.std.com/~swmcd/steven/tech/daemon.html)

Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for you are crunchy and good with ketchup. -- Steven W. McDougall (http://world.std.com/~swmcd/steven/perl/pm/xs/intro/index.html)

I have never taken any courses in computer science or software engineering.  -- esr (http://www.catb.org/~esr/resume.html)

Rush to launch something... anything... and build on it. Reduce the scope to the minimum; avoid the temptation to add "just this one last thing" before you launch. -- Tom Limoncelli (http://everythingsysadmin.com/2016/03/wasting-one-million-dollars.html)

You can talk and talk and have great ideas, but if you don't have a way of sharing those ideas then you are just saying it in you own bubble. -- Tom Limoncelli (http://stephenibaraki.com/acm/interviews/v0116/tom_limoncelli_acm.html)

There is one thing which will make no difference to your performance as a system administrator but will make getting another job in technology vastly easier, and that is a college degree, preferably in computer science or a related field. -- Elizabeth Zwicky (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/issues/1404_login_web.pdf)

Our migration plan was formed through an iterative process of research and implementation. -- Sebastian Gierlinger (https://www.digitalocean.com/customers/ghost)

If you shut the door to all the errors, truth will be shut out. -- Rabindranath Tagore

Be prepared to not understand things immediately, and take the time to go over things again and again until you've learned them. When you are teaching someone, expect to repeat yourself a lot. -- Joshua Zimmerman (http://sysadvent.blogspot.sk/2015/12/day-22-simplicity-in-complex-systems.html)

Talk to all the people that are involved and figure out what real need is and re-examine whether the "largest value" is actually needed, how it is needed, and whether the entire process can be improved by looking at it end-to-end. -- Tom Limoncelli (http://everythingsysadmin.com/2015/11/operations-and-big-o-analysis.html)

One of the best programmers I ever hired had only a High School degree; ... -- Peter Norvig (http://norvig.com/21-days.html)

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. -- Kernighan & Plauger: The Elements of Programming Style (1978)

... you don't know whether you can do something until you've done it. -- ULSAH

As a system administrator, automating the work that needs to be done should be the majority of your job. We should not make changes to the system, we should instruct the automation to make those changes. -- PSNA2

He used the word "kata", because he understood that repetition creates habits, and habits are what enable mastery. -- The Phoenix Project

Mike Rothers says that it almost doesn't matter what you improve, as long as you are improving something. -- The Phoenix Project

From a career-management point of view, I think it is important to be really really really good at one of them [Perl/Ruby/Python] and know a little of the others; even if that means just reading the first few chapters of a book on the topic. -- Tom Limoncelli (http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/06/salang.html)

The choice of perl/python/ruby is usually driven by what is already in use at your shop. -- Tom Limoncelli (http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/06/salang.html)

I think every Unix/Linux sysadmin should know shell (sh or bash) plus one of Perl, Ruby, Python. It doesn't matter which. -- Tom Limoncelli (http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/06/salang.html)

As a system grows, it will become more complex. That is a fact of life. Therefore, starting out as simple as possible delays the day when a system becomes too complex. -- PoSaNA

The best optimization strategy is to steal from what smarter people have already done. -- brian d foy (http://www.masteringperl.org/2015/05/computing-excellent-numbers/)

Networking is when you can't get any work done because of the failure of a machine you have never heard of. -- ULSAH

We're a Puppet shop, though If I could do it over, I'd switch to either Ansible or SaltStack. -- Linux Foundation System Administrator Konstanin Ryabitsev (http://www.linux.com/news/featured-blogs/200-libby-clark/814542-15-reddit-ama-questions-for-kernelorg-sysadmin-konstantin-ryabitsev)

Diversity of software, hardware, and network connectivity are the keys to surviving the Darwinian pressure of the Internet. Add geographical location and sysadmin skills to your diversity pile and you will be in fine shape. -- ULSAH: DNS

A host can only route packets to gateway machines that are reachable through a directly connected network. The local hosts's job is limited to moving packets one hop closer to their destinations, so it is pointless to include information about nonadjacent gateways in the local routing table. -- ULSAH

Information security professionals and System Administrators alike have a tendency to strive for a perfect solution. System Administrators, however, often times have enough practical experience to know that those rarely exist, and that deploying a reasonable, but not perfect, solution to a problem upon which can be iterated in the future is almost always preferable. -- Jan Schaumann (http://sysadvent.blogspot.co.at/2014/12/day-20-infosec-basics-reason-behind.html)

Failure free operations require experience with failure. -- Richard Cook (http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/How%20Complex%20Systems%20Fail.pdf)

As in bash, Perl has a dedicated "else if" condition, but its keyword is elsif rather than elif. (For you who use both languages, these fun, minute differences either keep you mentally nimble or drive you insane.) -- ULSAH

Keep in mind that hostnames are really just a convenient shortcut for IP addresses, and as such, they refer to network interfaces rather than computers. -- ULSAH

... when I'm learning something new, my approach is to have a well defined end-goal in mind, then I learn the details as I solve problems to get to that point. -- Andrew Solomon (http://www.linuxcareer.com/perl-as-a-career-option)

Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naive ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher's ideals are. -- Richard Feynman (http://genius.cat-v.org/richard-feynman/writtings/letters/problems)

I would advise you to take even simpler, or as you say, humbler, problems until you find some you really solve easily, no matter how trivial. -- Richard Feynman (http://genius.cat-v.org/richard-feynman/writtings/letters/problems)

The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to. -- Richard Feynman (http://genius.cat-v.org/richard-feynman/writtings/letters/problems)

The name servers listed in resolv.conf must be configured to allow your host to submit querries and must answer them completely (be recursive), not refer you to other name servers. -- ULSAH, 4th, p. 561

the GUIs tend to ignore advanced configurations, and they are relatively inconvenient for remote and automated administration. -- ULSAH, 4th

The distinguishing characteristic of commands in /sbin is usually that they're linked with "static" versions of the system libraries and therefore don't have many dependencies on other parts of the system. -- ULSAH, 4th

The basic purpose of a filesystem is to represent and organize the system's storage resources. -- ULSAH, 4th

The more that we can show our appreciation, the better we'll feel, the nicer we'll be to each other and the more we'll be able to do together. -- brian d foy (http://perltricks.com/article/75/2014/3/6/Perl-master-an-interview-with-brian-d-foy)

There is not such thing as best practice unless you specify the context. -- brian d foy (http://perltricks.com/article/75/2014/3/6/Perl-master-an-interview-with-brian-d-foy)

Be a carpenter, not a hammer operator. -- abw (http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1ykvr8/the_midcareer_crisis_of_the_perl_programmer/cflrs5n)

My career advice is to only do projects that produce usable output every few weeks or months. Being on a project that will not show any results for a year or more is a good way to hide from management. Being invisible is a career killer. -- Limoncelli

Perl’s syntax rules make dereferencing complex expressions tricky—it falls into the category of “hard things that should be possible.” -- Alpaca Book

All of these tasks can be improved with better tools. Good tools are a stepping stone to automation. -- Limoncelli

Today's kids have too much technology, so they think a simple FTP archive is stupid. They try to build overly-complex systems which they then lose interest in. -- brian d foy (http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=674742)

If you dance with the devil, the devil don't change. The devil changes you. -- Max California

The notion of "play" and "work" are best described as a quantum superposition blur for a sysadmin... -- David N. Blank-Edelman

and so far they seem like a great bunch of folks. the sort of folk who just like to quietly do good in the world :) -- TimToady a.k.a. Larry Wall (http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-10-17#i_7723873)

When my career in technology started, I was a system administrator. If you think programmers are lazy, you don't know many really good system administrators. My rule was "If I'm bored four days out of five, I've done my job well." A bad system administrator will ignore problems. A good system administrator will prevent problems, often through a combination of automation and monitoring. -- chromatic (http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2013/10/automation-paralysis-and-false-laziness.html)

Laziness is a virtue in programmers, but like any virtue, it's easy to take it too far (or not far enough), in which it becomes a vice. -- chromatic (http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2013/10/automation-paralysis-and-false-laziness.html)

Yes, I know I write perl code like a C programmer, that's not an insult to me. -- Greg Kroah-Hartman (http://kroah.com/log/blog/2013/09/11/xxd-i/)

The only meaningful definition of a "generalist" is a specialist who can relate his own small area to the universe of knowledge. -- Peter Drucker (http://tomtunguz.com/the-myth-of-the-generalist)

That's also error-prone; eyes are not optimized for picking out small differences in the middle of large amounts of nearly identical text. -- Damian Conway (http://www.perl.com/pub/2005/07/14/bestpractices.html)

It is very difficult to quantify and measure quality, ... However, like porn, we know quality when we see it. -- Kwalitee wiki (http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php?title=Kwalitee)

Red cars tend to be fast, but your car will not go faster if you paint it red. -- Kwalitee wiki (http://perl-qa.hexten.net/wiki/index.php?title=Kwalitee)

when all else fails, read the error message -- TimToady (http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-07-21)

Which is not to say that “true” and “false” aren’t useful concepts. I just tend to view them along the same lines as “infinity” or “the square root of negative one”—extremely useful abstractions that quite possibly don’t have any concrete representation in the physical world. -- Barefoot Coder (http://barefootcoder.blogspot.sk/2010/08/balance-and-paradox.html)

You can either howl at the injustice of it all, or you can delight in the fact that a single well-handled trouble ticket scores as many brownie points as five hours of midnight debugging. You pick! -- Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook

A university exists to teach a student how to teach themselves, to sift through data and find information, and to separate the proprable from the improbable. -- maddog (http://www.lpi.org/blog/free-software-small-country-part-two-training)

I remember a family friend telling me when I was a kid that computers are going to be the future and that there will be a lot of jobs in this field. I also remember that the idea of sitting all day, alone, in front of a minitel-like computer scared the hell out of me. -- Matt Aimonetti (http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2012/11/14/engineers-suck-at-finding-right-jobs/)

For that you need some sort of metrics helping you to see if you are getting closer or farther from the direction you set for yourself. -- Matt Aimonetti (http://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2012/11/14/engineers-suck-at-finding-right-jobs/)

Do not jump into management too quickly. Spend a long time learning the technology. -- Ed Amoroso (http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail965.html)

Perl is just a language and you can get almost anything done with it, but the more valuable thing is knowledge about the problem you're trying to solve. -- brian d foy (http://www.learning-perl.com/2013/05/advice-to-a-new-perl-user/)

Byl to velmi zvláštní člověk. Komunistický režim jej po sovětském vzoru prohlásil za psychicky nemocného (diagnóza paranoia kverulans), protože režimní psychiatři i režim sám uvažoval logicky: každý, kdo se bouří proti neporazitelnému systému s vědomím, že nemá šanci, musí být přece blázen. -- Martin M.

In the HN [Hacker News] echo chamber, it seems like everyone who's anyone has moved on to ruby, rails, python, django, etc. Look into the every-web. My god, it's full of perl. -- noonespecial (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4461427)

Also sword is not sharpened on the thick side. Go find and sharpen your strenghts and learn to accept your weaknesses. Both are essential parts of you. -- Johnnie Thinker (http://www.johnnie-thinker.com/)

What did The Hustle™ accomplish? I gained weight. I wasn’t spending enough time with my (now) wife. I felt like shit. I began to resent my work, and the work I was producing clearly wasn’t my best. I started cutting corners. I went from a mindset of shipping with quality and integrity to “when is this going to be over?” -- Kyle Bragger (https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/ef4772e3c628)

Just what exactly is the problem you're looking to solve here? What are the metrics to support that? Whom are you looking to convince? How will the solution be rolled out? Who's going to do the work? What's it going to cost? How will you know when the work is done? How will you know whether it's working? -- VM Brasseur (http://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com/2013/02/28/rename-perl-5-marketing-ur-doin-it-wrong/)

If you're making a mess, stop. Take a deep breath. Then solve a small piece of the problem in an elegant way. Make sure you understand it. Then solve another small piece. Make both pieces work together elgantly. Make sure you understand that. Repeat until you have solved the problem. -- chromatic (http://www.modernperlbooks.com/mt/2013/04/how-to-identify-clunky-perl-5-code.html)

The greatness is measured by how much freedom you give to others, not by how much you can coerce others to do that you want. -- Larry Wall (http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html) 

The very fact that it's possible to write messy programs in Perl is also what makes it possible to write programs that are cleaner in Perl than they could ever be in a language that attempts to write extremely clean, concise, and beautiful programs. The potential for greater good goes right along with the potential for greater evil. -- Larry Wall (http://www.wall.org/~larry/pm.html)

Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. -- punch_card_don (http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=396320)

Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow; He who would search for pearls, must dive below. -- John Dryden

I've always lived cheaply ... like a student, basically. And I liked that, because it means that money is not telling me what to do. -- Richard Stallman (rms)

The universe doesn't come with enforced style guidelines. Creative people will develop style on their own. -- Larry Wall (http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/02/09/06/1343222/larry-wall-on-perl-religion-and)

Perl is obviously my attempt to help other people to be creative. In my little way, I'm sneakily helping people understand a bit more about the sort of people God likes. -- Larry Wall (http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/02/09/06/1343222/larry-wall-on-perl-religion-and)

The primary Perl slogan is: "There's more than one way to do it." The secondary Perl slogan is: "Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible." -- Larry Wall (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=7137)

But if Perl is everything it ought to be, it will naturally attract serious attention over the long term. If ecological niches are natural, and if nature abhors a vacuum, it follows that ecological niches abhor vacuums too. I expect to hear some great sucking sounds over the next ten or twenty years. -- Larry Wall in 2002 (http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/02/09/06/1343222/larry-wall-on-perl-religion-and)

It is an unfortunate fact that, human nature being what it is, an ounce of cheerleading often beats a pound of rational discussion. -- Larry Wall (http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/02/09/06/1343222/larry-wall-on-perl-religion-and)

It should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid. -- Albert Einstein

You learn a natural language once and use it many times. The lesson for a language designer is that a language should be optimized for expressive power [breadth of ideas that can be represented and communicated] rather than for ease of learning. .. It's okay if a language is difficult to learn, as long as you don't have to learn it all at once. -- Larry Wall: Natural Language Principles in Perl (http://www.wall.org/~larry/natural.html)

It can do everything I want to do, and I already know it. If I wasn't a Perl programmer, I'd probably be happy in Ruby or Python.

Keep these principles in mind as you read the rest of this book. -- Modern Perl (http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl)

It can get confusing. Hey, I'm confused most of the time. -- Larry Wall, Perl Cookbook's foreword

Well done is better than well said. -- Benjamin Franklin

At its heart, science is a way of discovering the world by making small, controlled, testable hypotheses, testing them, and seeing what happens. At its heart, a lot of programming is the same way.

The novice frowned  and said: “Perl's regexps would be excessive for so simple a task. I do not know awk, and I have been writing sed scripts in the last few weeks. As I have some experience with sed, at the moment I would prefer it.

''Prečo sa absolvent najlepšej právnickej školy sveta po zložení skúšok do newyorskej advokátskej komory nevyberie robiť kariéru do LA, Chicaga alebo New Yorku, ale vráti sa na Slovensko?'' Kvôli rodine, priateľom, tej zvláštnej zmesi kadidla a vlhkých stien, ktorú som od puberty nasával v Kapucínskom kostole, kvôli možnosti sadnúť pred domom na autobus a do polhodiny sa s kamarátmi stretnúť na terase v Bašte alebo v Depresse, kvôli intimite, ktorú prináša rozhovor v materinskom jazyku, spoločná minulosť a všetko to ostatné, čo tvorí vlasť nášho srdca. V skratke, kvôli pocitu, že doma je najlepšie a pre mňa je doma na Slovensku.

"Nemáš pri svojej práci pocit márnosti, že aj tak neovplyvníš to, ako študentov vyformovala rodina a priatelia?" Sčasti áno. Pomáham si takouto predstavou: si na kopci, fúka silný vietor a ty máš za úlohu zapáliť sviečku. Je celkom možné, že sa ti to nepodarí, ale nemal by si skončiť skôr, než škrtneš poslednou zápalkou...

Talent je tá najvzácnejšia surovina, ktorou by sme nemali za žiadnych okolností mrhať. Talent a tvorivosť sú vzácne komodity a každá generácia ich prináša len obmedzené množstvo. Nemôžeme ich nijako vyrábať, aj keď udusiť ich môžeme tisícimi spôsobmi. -- Gottfried Schatz

Jadrom jeho politického konania je redukovanie politiky do podoby konzumenta, závislého od vrtkavých nálad populácie.

Najmenej sa boja smrti tí, ktorých život má najväčšiu cenu. -- Kant

Ľudská bytosť je časťou celku, ktorý my nazývame Vesmír, časť ktorá je obmedzená v čase a priestore. Zažíva seba, jej myšlienky a pocity, ako niečo oddelené od zvyšku – akýsi druh optického klamu jej vedomia. Tento klam je pre nás akýmsi druhom väzenia, obmedzujúcim nás na naše osobné túžby a náklonnosť pre niekoľko osôb v našej blízkosti. Našou úlohou musí by vyslobodiť sa z tohto väzenia, rozšírením okruhu našeho súcitu pre všetky žijúce bytosti a celú prírodu v jej kráse. -- Albert Einstein
